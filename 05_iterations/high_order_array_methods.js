/*

High Order Array loops in JavaScript are methods that allow you to iterate over arrays and perform operations on each element in a more declarative way, compared to traditional for loops. These methods take a callback function as an argument, which is executed for each element in the array. Some common high-order array methods include:

1)
forEach()
Purpose: Executes a provided function once for each array element.

2)
filter()
Purpose: Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test provided by the callback function.

3)
map()
Purpose: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.

4)
reduce()
Purpose: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element of the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
